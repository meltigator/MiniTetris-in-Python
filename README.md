# ___MiniTetris in Python – Retro Console Power___

What happens when you mix Python’s simplicity with a classic like Tetris? You get a clean, console-based MiniTetris that brings pure nostalgia in under low lines of code.

This mini-project is a personal tribute to minimalist development—no frameworks, no dependencies, just Python and a bit of magic.

## Features: 

* Runs in the terminal on any OS with Python 3 

* Clean, grid-based logic with falling tetrominoes 

* Keyboard controls via raw input 

* Open-source and ready to tweak on GitHub


## Perfect for anyone who wants to explore console gaming mechanics, code efficiency, or just relax with retro vibes.
